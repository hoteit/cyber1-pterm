# cyber1-pterm
modified Cyber1 Pterm to compile on ArchLinux with wxwidgets3.2

When I installed [Cyber 1 - PTERM](https://www.cyber1.org/pterm.asp) on my local ArchLinux machine, I ran into C++ compilation issues due to incompatibility with WXWidgets 3.3

I made the changes in the various CPP files to support WXWidgets to Char* conversions
